<!-- HTML is parsed permissibly by browsers, meaning even though some syntax errors exist
     in the HTML script, browsers display it anyway, ignoring the syntax-error part, or
     inferring the syntax if some closing tags are missed.
     So if I find some html elements are ignored, it's most probably because of some syntax
     errors happening in the ignored part.
